NAO Python SDK: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 Applictaion

I am just trying to program NAO robot remotely without the use of Choreographe. 

I have installed Python 2.7.18 and I installed the latest version of Python SDK from here https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/nao6/downloads/nao6-downloads-windows

But nao that I am trying to run my code, I am receiving this error.
